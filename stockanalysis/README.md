## Execute the program:
- mvn clean install

## To-do:
- [ ] Identify important classes and interfaces
- [ ] Research simple design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Command, Builder)
      and identify possible uses within program logic
- [ ] Create basic Model-View-Controller template with temporary stock data file
      to graph on the canvas
